# Welcome to the TokiDAO API Documentation

This site provides comprehensive documentation for the TokiDAO FastAPI backend project.

## Overview

TokiDAO is a gamified plant and mushroom database and garden tracking platform. This documentation covers the technical aspects of its backend API, including setup, architecture, development guidelines, and API reference.

## Navigation

Use the navigation panel (or tabs at the top) to explore different sections:

- **Project Setup & Details:** Information about the project's goals, technology stack, and dependencies.
- **Development Guide:** TODO lists, issue tracking, and coding conventions.
- **API Reference:** Links to the live, auto-generated API documentation (Swagger & ReDoc).
- **Changelog:** A record of all notable changes to the project.

## Getting Started

If you are a new developer on this project, please start by reading the [Project Log](PROJECT.md) and the main `README.md` in the repository root.

To run the API server locally, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main `README.md` and then use:

uvicorn main:app --reload
```

To view or build this documentation site locally, you will need MkDocs installed. See instructions in the main project `README.md` (we will add them there).
